## Description:

The website project described aims to provide a personalized skincare routine to the users based on their specific skin type and skincare goals. The user experience of the website is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, as users are prompted to fill out a simple questionnaire with only two questions.

The first question asks the user to select their skin type from a dropdown menu, which allows the user to easily choose from a list of options without having to type anything. This helps to ensure that the user can quickly and easily provide the necessary information to the website.

The second question allows the user to select their top two skincare goals from a list of options using checkboxes. This method of selection is effective because it enables the user to select multiple options without having to rank them in order of importance. Additionally, limiting the user to two checkboxes ensures that the recommended skincare routine is not overwhelming or unrealistic for the user to follow.

Once the user has completed the questionnaire, the website generates a list of recommended products for their personalized skincare routine. This feature enhances the usability of the website, as it provides the user with clear and specific guidance on which products to use based on their unique needs and preferences.

The HTML code is a form that allows users to answer two questions related to their skin type and skincare goals, and then click a button to generate a routine based on their responses. The first question is implemented as a select dropdown menu using the HTML <select> element. The user can choose their skin type from a list of four options: oily, dry, combination, and normal. Each option is defined using the HTML <option> element with the corresponding value attribute set to the corresponding skin type.

The second question is implemented as a checkbox list using the HTML <input> element with the type attribute set to "checkbox". The user can select up to two checkboxes from a list of six options, each corresponding to a specific skincare goal. These options include: anti-aging, reduce dark spots/discolorations, improve skin texture, radiant and glowing skin, reduce enlarged pores, and diminish acne/breakouts.

The CSS code provides visual styling for the HTML elements. It applies a basic layout and formatting to the page, such as setting the background color and font style. It also styles the form elements to make them more visually appealing and easier to use, such as adding padding and borders to the checkboxes and select dropdown menu.
